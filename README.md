Introduction
In the modern era, where technology intertwines deeply with everyday life, chatbots have emerged as valuable tools in various domains, including healthcare. This repository aims to showcase the development and enhancements of a medical chatbot system capable of answering queries related to health concerns, symptoms, treatments, and more.

Basepaper
The initial phase of this project involved the creation of a baseline system. This included the development of a medical chatbot web application using a sequential model and LSTM model. The primary focus was on comparing the prediction accuracy and performance between the two models. The basepaper serves as the foundation upon which subsequent improvements were built.

Improvements
Following the completion of the basepaper, several enhancements were implemented to augment the capabilities of the medical chatbot:

Dataset Enhancement: The dataset used for training the chatbot was improved by incorporating additional medical information. This enriched dataset enables the chatbot to provide more accurate and comprehensive responses to user queries.

Transformer Model: A transformer model was introduced as an alternative architecture for the chatbot. This model leverages the transformer architecture's attention mechanism to capture dependencies across input sequences effectively.

Sequential and Seq-to-Seq LSTM: In addition to the initial LSTM model, both sequential and seq-to-seq LSTM models were developed and integrated into the chatbot system. These variations were explored to evaluate their effectiveness in handling medical queries and improving response quality.

Models
The repository includes implementations of multiple models for the medical chatbot system:

1 Sequential Model: A basic sequential model for processing medical queries.
2 LSTM Model: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for capturing sequential dependencies in the input data.
3 Transformer Model: Transformer architecture-based model for enhanced performance in understanding and generating responses.
4 Sequential LSTM: Sequential LSTM model designed specifically for medical query processing.
5 Seq-to-Seq LSTM: Sequence-to-Sequence LSTM model for handling more complex medical queries and generating informative responses.
Usage
To utilize the medical chatbot system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
Choose the desired model implementation from the models directory.
Train the selected model using the provided dataset or your custom dataset.
Deploy the trained model in a suitable environment (web application, API, etc.).
Interact with the chatbot by providing medical queries and evaluating the responses.
